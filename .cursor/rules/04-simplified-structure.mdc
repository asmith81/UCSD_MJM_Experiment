# Simplified Structure
- Organize code by function rather than complex inheritance hierarchies
- Use utility modules with logical grouping of related functions
- Create thin notebooks that import functionality from utility modules
- Keep core logic in utility modules, not notebooks
- Minimize interdependencies between components
