# Configuration Management
- Use simple configuration files (YAML or JSON)
- Move environment setup, dependencies, and paths to source modules
- Store prompt templates in separate files for reference
- Keep model-specific loading and inference functions in source code
- Allow notebooks to be thin execution environments
