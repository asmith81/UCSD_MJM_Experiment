# Functional Programming Approach
- Use stateless functions that transform data rather than complex classes
- Minimize state management to reduce complexity
- Use simple data structures (dictionaries, lists) for data exchange
- Focus on pipeline-oriented processing for clarity
- Clear input/output contracts for each function
