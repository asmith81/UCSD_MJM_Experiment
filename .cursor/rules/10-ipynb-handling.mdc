# Notebook Handling
## File Types
- Do not attempt to write ipynb files.
- Write all notebook files in .py format
- All testing and debugging will be done in .py format then we will convert to .ipynb using jupytext
## Environment setup
- Each notebook must be structured to act independently in a separate kernel
- All dependencies must be installed at the beginning of each notebook
- All paths need to be re-established with respect to root at the beginning of each notebook
    - Use a separate cell to determine the root dir
## Scope
- All notebooks should be thinly scoped as user-interface documents.  Most processing should be done by calls to source code
